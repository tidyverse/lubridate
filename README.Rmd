## Overview

Date-time data can be frustrating to work with in R. R commands for date-times are generally unintuitive and change depending on the type of date-time object being used. Moreover, the methods we use with date-times must be robust to time zones, leap days, daylight savings times, and other time related quirks, and R lacks these capabilities in some situations. Lubridate makes it easier to do the things R does with date-times and possible to do the things R does not.

If you are new to lubridate, the best place to start is the
[date and times chapter](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html) in R
for data science.


## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# The easiest way to get lubridate is to install the whole tidyverse:
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Alternatively, install just lubridate:
install.packages("lubridate")

# Or the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/lubridate")
```

## Cheatsheet

## Features

```{r}
library(lubridate, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
```

*   Easy and fast parsing of date-times: `ymd()`, `ymd_hms`, `dmy()`, `dmy_hms`,
    `mdy()`, ...

    ```{r}
    ymd(20101215)
    mdy("4/1/17")
    ```

*   Simple functions to get and set components of a date-time, such as `year()`,
    `month()`, `mday()`, `hour()`, `minute()` and `second()`:

    ```{r}
    bday <- dmy("14/10/1979")
    month(bday)
    wday(bday, label = TRUE)

    year(bday) <- 2016
    wday(bday, label = TRUE)
    ```

*   Helper functions for handling time zones: `with_tz()`, `force_tz()`

    ```{r}
    time <- ymd_hms("2010-12-13 15:30:30")
    time

    # Changes printing
    with_tz(time, "America/Chicago")

    # Changes time
    force_tz(time, "America/Chicago")
    ```

Lubridate also expands the type of mathematical operations that can be performed with date-time objects. It introduces three new time span classes borrowed from https://www.joda.org.

* `durations`, which measure the exact amount of time between two points

* `periods`, which accurately track clock times despite leap years, leap
  seconds, and day light savings time

* `intervals`, a protean summary of the time information between two points
