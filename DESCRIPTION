Description: Lubridate makes it easier to work with dates
    and times by providing functions to identify and
    parse date-time data, extract and modify components
    of a date-time (years, months, days, hours, minutes,
    and seconds), perform accurate math on date-times,
    handle time zones and Daylight Savings Time.
    Lubridate has a consistent, memorable syntax, that
    makes working with dates fun instead of frustrating.
