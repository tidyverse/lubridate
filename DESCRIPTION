Description: Lubridate makes it easier to work with dates
    and times by providing functions to identify and parse
    date-time data, extract and modify components of a
    date-time (years, months, days, hours, minutes, and
    seconds), perform accurate math on date-times, handle
    time zones and Daylight Savings Time. Lubridate has a
    consistent, memorable syntax, that makes working with
    dates fun instead of frustrating.
