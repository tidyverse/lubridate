#' Cyclic encoding of date-times
#'
#' Encode a date-time object into a cyclic coordinate system in which the
#' distances between two pairs of dates separated by the same time duration are
#' the same.
#'
#' Machine learning models don't know that December 31st and January 1st are
#' close in our human calendar sense. `cyclic_encoding` makes it obvious to the
#' machine learner that two calendar dates are close by mapping the dates onto
#' the circle.
#'
#' @param x a date-time object
#' @param periods a character vector of periods. Follows same specification as
#'   [period] and [floor_date] functions.
#' @param encoders names of functions to produce the encoding. Defaults to
#'   "sin" and "cos". Names of any predefined functions accepting a numeric
#'   input are allowed.
#' @param week_start day starting a week (used for weekly periods).
#' @return a numeric matrix with number of columns equal `length(periods) *
#'   length(types)`.
