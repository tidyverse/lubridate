See Period period(). choice units trivial; units normally equal may differ length depending time period occurs. example, leap second occurs one minute longer 60 seconds. periods fixed length, can accurately converted Duration objects. Duration objects measure time spans exact numbers seconds, see Duration. Hence, one one mapping exist durations periods. used Duration object, .period provides inexact estimate; duration broken time units based common lengths time units, seconds. length months particularly variable, period months unit can coerced duration object. exact transformation, first transform duration interval .interval(). Coercing interval period may cause surprising behavior request periods small units. leap year 366 days long, one year long. interval convert 366 days unit set days 1 year unit set years. Adding 366 days date often give different result adding one year. Daylight savings one exception apply. Interval lengths calculated UTC timeline, use daylight savings. Hence, periods converted seconds minutes reflect actual variation seconds minutes occurs due daylight savings. periods show \"naive\" change seconds minutes suggested differences clock time.
